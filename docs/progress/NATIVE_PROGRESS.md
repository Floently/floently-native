## Completed

- Native repository created and pushed.
- Android Learn debug build verified.
- Auth, secure session storage, API client, product access gate, Learn app container, and signed-in shell are in place.
- YKI, Professional Finnish, Roleplay, Cards, Progress, and Account native foundations are in place.
- Learn readiness dashboard, production gates dashboard, Account boundary, and Progress sync boundary are verified.
- Floently suite shell is verified with Learn, Read, Create, product selector, separate access checks, and product-neutral sign-in.
- Native Read MVP vertical slice is available but no longer release-blocking for the first release.
- Create Studio MVP vertical slice is available but no longer release-blocking for the first release.
- Payments and entitlement service wiring is verified using existing backend routes and fallback-safe UI without new Learn environment variables.
- Read/Create backend service wiring is available for later release-quality work.
- Learn roleplay, cards, and progress service wiring is verified while preserving the existing Learn UI/function structure.
- Store/signing readiness is verified with ignored signing properties, optional signing config, signing status command, release build, and release bundle build.
- Store submission and manual QA pack is verified with listing draft, screenshot checklist, data-safety prompts, release notes draft, and real-device checklist.
- Final release blocker dashboard cleanup is verified with only true blockers remaining: live backend QA, payment provider checkout, local release signing, privacy/data-safety/screenshots, and manual real-device QA.
- Final local QA runbook is verified with fixed-order build, install, auth, suite, Learn, Read, Create, payment/access, offline/error, signing, and result-recording instructions.
- Learn-first release decision is recorded: complete and polish Learn first, release Learn, then continue Read and Create to release quality.
- M16-A replaced the Learn home engineering/status dashboard with a user-facing learning home.
- M16-B polished Roleplay and Cards with learner-facing copy, improved practice flow, conversation guidance, card reveal, card rating, and review summary.
- M16-C polished YKI and Professional Finnish with learner-facing copy, improved practice/session guidance, cleaner module cards, answer/response guidance, and completion summaries.
- M16-D polished Progress and Account with learner-facing progress, access, device, empty, and sign-out copy.
- M16-E prepared a fresh Learn release-candidate QA APK and exposed remaining wording-audit matches.
- M16-F cleaned user-facing fallback/audit wording in Roleplay, Cards, Account, YKI, and Professional Finnish; debug, release, and bundle builds passed.
- M16-G recorded the Learn 150% parity audit and augment-build backlog in `docs/release/LEARN_150_PARITY_AUDIT.md`.
- M17-A started native i18n restoration: old language metadata is present, FI/SV/EN copy is available, Settings exists, language persistence is added, and Learn home/shell are wired to language settings.
- M17-A follow-up corrected the release-contract compile error and changed Settings to show all 20 final web Learn language options.
- M17-A2 aligned native language availability with the final web build: all 20 languages are enabled and complete, debug build passed, and release build passed.
- Release build preparation is verified with production application ID, Floently app label, version bump, debug suffix, release build type, release build command, and release checklist.
- Learn UI and environment guardrails are verified: Learn is improvement-only, not a rebuild; functions are preserved; no new Learn environment variables unless explicitly approved.

## Active task

Build Learn to 150% of the old app before release, using the final web build as the source of truth for parity.

## Next step

Start M17-A3: import or mirror final web translations into native Learn so all 20 selected languages have real native translated UI copy, not only enabled metadata.

## Pending verification

- M17-A3 should compare native translation keys against the final web build, add complete translated Learn copy for all 20 languages where available, preserve RTL metadata for Arabic, Persian, and Urdu, and build debug/release successfully.
